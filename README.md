### READ ME
--- Project Phase 1 ---
    - Create a blogsite post with:
        - Sign up
        - Sign in
        - Log out
        - When logged in: Dashboard with the blog articles (title, author, date, image, text)

## GOALS
- [DONE] Set up directus database on Render.com.
- [    ] Create a simple "article" collection on directus database.
- [    ] MVP: Set up directus authentication for login, logout, signup
- [    ] Check if the codes properly call out all the authentication & functions created.
- [    ] Set up author role to only be able to edit their own content -> Created user must be automatically author role.

- Modularization:
  - Review code to plan for DRY high level (layouts)
  - Review code for needed error handling (user facing and dev facing)
  - Outline and build components (minimal styles, focus on functionality)
  - Style content and make it responsive
